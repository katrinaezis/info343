<h1 class="challenge-title">Group project</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is your opportunity to reflect on how your group has worked together throughout the project.  In the provided template, you'll describe the division of labor of the project, and provide comments on yourself, as well as each one of your peers in the group.  Each project will receive the same grade, and these evaluations will provide a tool for adjusting individual student grades up or down.  These adjustments will only happen if it is clear that a member of the group was an exceptional attribute to the group, or a notable detriment.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Fill out this <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/973387/files/32315074/" target="_blank">template</a> to describe the division of labor in the project, detail the contributions you made, and provide feedback on each one of your group memebers.</p>
