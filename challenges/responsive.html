<p>One of the most common web development projects is a marketing site for an organization or product. Most every organization and product has one, and it's amazing how many of them are really terrible. Many of them have ugly or distracting visual design, or poor organization of their content. And most look terrible on mobile devices with small screens.</p>

<p>This is a shame because it's just not that hard to build a well-designed, responsive marketing site. In this challenge you will build one of these sites for a fictitious coffee shop named Dawg Coffee. This site will respond to the size of screen it is rendered on, and adjust its layout and styling accordingly.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>By completing this challenge you will practice and master the following skills</p>

<ul>
    <li>Writing semantically-rich HTML pages by choosing the most appropriate elements to wrap around your information</li>
    <li>Writing well-formatted HTML source that is properly-indented and easy to read</li>
    <li>Creating hyperlinks that tie pages together</li>
    <li>Using HTML character entities to represent reserved or difficult to input characters</li>
    <li>Creating a stylesheet and linking it to your web pages</li>
    <li>Writing style rules and using styling properties to control the formatting of your pages, including fonts, colors, links, backgrounds, borders, padding, margins, and layouts</li>

<h2>Required Steps</h2>

<p>To complete this challenge, follow these steps. If you get stuck, consult the resources above, Q&amp;A sites like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, or ask with your TA or instructor for help.</p>

<p>Here are screen shots of the home page you will be building, as it will look on smaller and larger screen</p>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/dawg-coffee-sm.png" alt="dawg-coffee section on small screens">

<p class="alert alert-warning">You don't have to do a pixel-perfect reproduction of these screen shots, but your version should be very close. I will provide all the color values and specific measurements you need to know, but you may have to make a few adjustments to get it looking just right. In many projects you will get screen shots like these from a graphic designer, and it's your job to create a page that looks as close to those as possible.</p>

<h3>Fork and Clone the Challenges Repository</h3>

<p>If you haven't already done so, start by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">forking</a> our <a href="https://github.com/INFO343-2015/challenges">challenges starter repository</a>. This repository contains a directory for each challenge, and in that directory are the various file stubs, images, and other assets you'll need. You only need to fork this once into your own GitHub account, but you may need to pull changes from time to time if I discover something I need to adjust in an upcoming challenge.</p>

<p>After you've forked the repository into your own account, <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository">clone</a> it to your machine so you can work on the files.</p>

<h3>Build and Style the Home Page</h3>
<p>In the <code>/dawg-coffee</code> subdirectory, create a new file named <code>index.html</code>. This will contain the contents of the site home page.</p>

<p>Then create a subdirectory named <code>css</code> and inside that directory, create a file named <code>main.css</code></p>

<h4>Basic Page Structure</h4>
<p>As you learned in class, open <code>index.html</code> in your editor and build a basic web page. Remember to include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The HTML5 doctype declaration</li>
    <li>An element telling the browser that this page is saved in the UTF-8 text encoding</li>
    <li>An element telling the browser to set the viewport width to the device width, and the initial scaling to 1</li>
    <li>An element declaring the page title to be <code>Dawg Coffee</code></li>
    <li>An element declaring that the page's icon is the <code>page-icon.png</code> located in the <code>img</code> subdirectory.</li>
    <li>An element that adds the <code>main.css</code> stylesheet you created in the <code>css</code> directory to the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have the basic skeleton, you can go on to create and style each portion of the page.</p>

<h4>Base Page Styles</h4>

<p>You will be building this page in a "mobile first" approach. The base style rules will be the ones that should apply to small phone screens, and you will then add media queries to change those rules for larger screens.</p>

<p>In your <code>main.css</code> file, add the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import">directive to import</a> the Bootstrap CSS file from its <a href="http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/">content delivery network (CDN) location</a> <code>https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css</code>. You only need the CSS file, not the JavaScript file.</li>
    
    <li>Directives to import the Google fonts <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Raleway">Raleway</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Lato">Lato</a>. You will need the 300 and 400 weight normal face of both, and the 300-weight italic face of Lato.</li>
    
    <li>A directive to import the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/">Font Awesome</a> font from it's CDN location <code>https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css</code></li>
    
</ul>

<p>Then add some style rules that accomplish the following formatting:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The default font should be <code>Lato</code>, with Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, and sans-serif as the fall-backs if the browser cannot reach the Google fonts server.</li>
    <li>The default font size should be <code>16px</code> and the default weight should be <code>300</code>.</li>
    <li>The background color for the page should be <code>#E9EAEE</code>.</li>
    <li>All headings should use the font <code>Raleway</code>, with Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, and sans-serif as the fall-backs.</li>
    <li>All second-level headings should be in the color <code>#BC6026</code>.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, all second-level headings should be center aligned, and have a bottom margin of equal to the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/power-em-units-css/">height of the current font</a>.</li>
    <li>All <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements should be the same height as the current font.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Navigation Bar</h4>

<img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/navbar.png" alt="screenshot of navigation bar">

<p>Add the HTML elements for the navigation bar. Use the appropriate semantic elements for the entire <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp">navigation</a> bar, and the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp">unordered list</a> of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">links</a>.</p>

<p>For the icon on the left, use the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> content that is in the <code>svg/brand.svg</code> file. Copy and paste this into your HTML where it should appear, so that we can apply style rules to it.</p>

<p>The links in the navigation bar should take the user to the following locations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Coffee Cup Icon: the top of this page</li>
    <li>Cafe: the top of the cafe section on this page</li>
    <li>Menu: the top of the menu section on this page</li>
    <li>Story: the top of the story section on this page</li>
    <li>Order: the <code>order.html</code> page in the same directory as this page (you will create this later)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now create style rules in your <code>main.css</code> file to accomplish the following</p>

<ul>
    <li>The whole navigation bar should be fixed to the top of the viewport so that it doesn't scroll with the page.</li>
    <li>Background color should be <code>#181C22</code> by default, but should switch to <code>rgba(24, 28, 34, 0.8)</code> on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
    <li>The text color should be pure white.</li>
    <li>The font size should be <code>16</code> pixels.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>15</code> pixels of space between the edge of the screen and the first link (the icon).</li>
    <li>The list items should layout in a line as pictured, and not stack on top of each other like list items normally do.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>0.5em</code> of padding all around each of the links. The left and right padding should increase to <code>1em</code> on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
    <li>The links text should be rendered in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-variant.asp">small capitals</a> regardless of what case was used in the HTML.</li>
    <li>The links in this navigation bar should not have an underline like they normally do.</li>
    <li>When the links in this navigation bar get focus, or when you hover over them with the mouse, they should not have an underline, and their color should change to <code>#D87E28</code>. This should also occur for the SVG icon&mdash;note the CSS property that controls <a href="https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/">the fill color for SVG elements</a> is different from the one that controls text color!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Header Area</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/header-sm.png" alt="screenshot of header area on small screens">
    <figcaption>Header Area on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/header-lg.png" alt="screenshot of header area on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Header Area on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In your <code>index.html</code> page, add content for the header area. The 'Dawg Coffee' should be a top-level heading. Motto shown on larger screens is just a normal paragraph. Both of these should be inside a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container">Bootstrap container</a> so that they have a bit of padding and a maximum width.</p>

<p>Now add style rules to your <code>main.css</code> file to accomplish the following</p>

<ul>
    <li>The header area should have <code>3em</code> of padding on the top, so that the text is visible below the fixed navigation bar</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the header area should use the file <code>background-sm.jpg</code> in the <code>img</code> directory as the background image. The image should cover the entire header area, and not repeat.</li>
    <li>Also on this size of screen, the text in the header area should be pure white and aligned right.</li>
    <li>Also on this size of screen, the header area should have a minimum height of <code>550</code> pixels, so that more of the image is visible.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>992</code> pixels and wider, the background image for the header should be <code>background-md.jpg</code>. The 'Dawg Pizza' text should also be increased in size to <code>4em</code></li>
    <li>On screens <code>1200</code> pixels and wider, the background image for the header should be <code>background-lg.jpg</code>.</li>
    <li>The motto should not be displayed by default, but should appear on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Headline Section</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/headline-sm.png" alt="headline section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Headline Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/headline-lg.png" alt="headline section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Headline Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Below the header, add another section for what we might call the headline (see images above). This should contain the icon and a paragraph with the pictured text. The SVG for the icon is in the file <code>svg/brand.svg</code>. Just as with the header, these elements should be inside a Bootstrap container so that they get some padding and are constrained in width.</p>

<p>Add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The text in this section should be in italics.</li>
    <li>The SVG icon should be hidden by default, but should appear on screen sizes of <code>768</code> pixels and wider. When it is shown, it's size should be <code>1.5em</code> and it should have a bottom margin of <code>1em</code>.</li>
    <li>Also on screen sizes of <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the font size should grow to <code>1.25em</code>, the text should be center aligned, and the padding on top and bottom should increase to <code>3em</code>. This will give it a more spacious feeling, drawing the eye towards it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cafe Information Section</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/cafe-sm.png" alt="cafe section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Cafe Information Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/cafe-lg.png" alt="cafe section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Cafe Information Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next add another section for information about the cafe: its hours, location, and contact information. This section should have a responsive multi-column layout. By default the hours, location, and contact information blocks should stack on top of each other in a single column. But on screens <code>992</code> pixels and wider, the layout should switch to three adjacent columns. Use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options">Bootstrap's grid system</a> to achieve this effect. Remember that a Bootstrap grid should always be inside a Bootstrap container.</p>

<p>The SVG icons above each block of information are in the files <code>svg/hours.svg</code>, <code>svg/location.svg</code>, and <code>svg/contact.svg</code>.</p>

<p>In the hours block, the dash between the start and end times should be an '<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp">en-dash</a>', which is slightly longer than a hyphen, and is the appropriate punctuation to use when indicating a range between values.</p>

<p>The map image in the location block is in the file <code>img/map.png</code>. It should also be a hyperlink so that when the user clicks the map image, it <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp">opens a new browser window/tab</a> and navigates the browser to the URL <code>https://www.google.com/maps/place/4214+University+Way+NE,+Seattle,+WA+98105</code>.</p>

<p>The contact information block should list the email address, phone number, and Twitter handle for the cafe. The email address should be a hyperlink that when clicked, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/">opens a new email message</a> with that address in the To field. The phone number should be a hyperlink that when clicked on mobile phones, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/device-access/click-to-call/click-to-call?hl=en">prompts to start a new phone call</a> to that number (on other devices, it might invoke other telephony software if it has been configured). The Twitter handle should be a hyperlink that when clicked, opens a new tab and navigates the browser to the cafe's Twitter page at <code>https://twitter.com/dawgcoffee</code>.</p>

<p>The icons next to the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/envelope/">email address</a>, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/phone/">phone number</a>, and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/twitter/">Twitter handle</a> should come from the Font Awesome font that you imported into your stylesheet. </p>

<p>After you've added the necessary HTML elements, add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All text in this section should be center aligned (note that Bootstrap also defines <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment">a style class that center-aligns text</a>, so you may just add that style class to your section instead).</li>
    <li>The background color of this section should be <code>#dbdce3</code>.</li>
    <li>The map image should have rounded corners with a radius of <code>5</code> pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Menu Section</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/menu-sm.png" alt="menu section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Menu Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/menu-lg.png" alt="menu section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Menu Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, add a section for the menu. Like the section above, this should have a responsive multi-column layout. By default the Drinks and Treats blocks should stack on top of each other, but on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, they should appear side-by-side.</p>

<p>The menu items are pairs of names and descriptions, so use the most semantically-appropriate elements for these. That is, use elements that represent a list of name and description pairs, and not just a simple unordered list.</p>

<p>Note that the ampersand in the first item under Treats is a reserved character in HTML, so to embed this in the page, you must use its corresponding HTML character entity.</p>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The descriptions of each menu item should be in italics, and should be shifted right by <code>1em</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Our Story Section</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/story-sm.png" alt="story section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Our Story Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/story-lg.png" alt="story section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Our Story Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, add a section for the organization's story. The content in this section should be wrapped in a Bootstrap container so that it has the same padding as the other sections, and has a constrained width.</p>

<p>The image in this section is in the file <code>img/story.jpg</code>. The rest of the text is runs of <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/30-useful-and-hilarious-lorem-ipsum-generators/">Lorem Ipsum</a>. It's OK if your Lorem text is different than what is pictured here, so feel free to use one of the more creative generators!</p>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The image should be floated to the right, and by default it should have a maximum height of <code>300px</code>, and a left margin of <code>1em</code>.</li>
    <li>The image should have rounded edges with a radius of <code>5px</code>.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>769</code> pixels and wider, the maximum height should increase to <code>400px</code>.</li>
    <li>The background color of this section should be <code>#dbdce3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Footer</h4>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/footer-sm.png" alt="footer section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Footer on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/footer-lg.png" alt="footer section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Footer on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The last part of this page is the footer. Add an element that is the most semantically-appropriate for page footer content.</p>

<p>The layout for the footer is a responsive, multi-column one. By default, the first block (the Dawg Coffee copyright declaration) and the second block (the icons attribution) should be stacked on top of each other. On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, they should layout side-by-side. The first block should consume <code>3</code> Bootstrap grid units and the second block should consume <code>9</code> grid units.</p>

<p>The copyright declaration in the first block uses the copyright symbol. The easiest way to include this is to use the HTML symbol entity for the copyright sign.</p>

<p>The content in the second block is an attribution that is required by the license attached to the SVG icons we used. Copy and paste this content into that block:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;p&gt;Icons by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepik.com&quot; title=&quot;Freepik&quot;&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bogdanrosu.com&quot; title=&quot;Bogdan Rosu&quot;&gt;Bogdan Rosu&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flaticon.com&quot; title=&quot;Flaticon&quot;&gt;www.flaticon.com&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot; title=&quot;Creative Commons BY 3.0&quot;&gt;CC BY 3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The footer should have a border on top, <code>3px</code> tall, solid, in the color <code>#D87E28</code>.</li>
    <li>The background color for the footer should be <code>#afb3c2</code>.</li>
    <li>The font size should be <code>12px</code>.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>1em</code> of padding on the top.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the second block (the icons attribution) should be right aligned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build and Style the Orders Page</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/order-sm.png" alt="order section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Order page on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/order-lg.png" alt="order section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Order page on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lastly, create a placeholder page for the online ordering page. Create another HTML page in the same directory as your <code>index.html</code> named <code>order.html</code>. This page should contains the same basic structure as your home page, as well as the navigation bar. The header content is similar, but slightly adjusted (see pictures). There should be a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp">line break</a> between "Coffee" and "Orders" in the top-level heading. After the header there should be just a simple "coming soon..." paragraph inside a Bootstrap container. We will build this page in a later challenge.</p>

<p>The links in the navigation bar need to be adjusted so that all besides the 'order' link refer back to the <code>index.html</code> page, or a section within it. Click the 'order' link should scroll to the top of the current page.</p>

<h2>Advanced Optional Steps</h2>
<p>If you found the required steps easy, or if you're wanting some extra challenge, try one or more of these optional advanced steps. You will receive extra credit for these based on the difficulty of the step and quality of your implementation.</p>

<h3>Animated Transitions For Navigation Bar Hyperlink Hover Styles</h3>
<p>Both you and the Bootstrap library added style rules that change the formatting of hyperlinks when you hover over them, but these formatting changes happen instantly. Use the CSS <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/">transition</a></code> property to animate these changes over a short period of time (e.g., 0.3 seconds).</p>

<h3>Generate Your CSS Using Sass</h3>
<p>You may have noticed several things that were repeated in a few different style rules, especially color values. In larger projects this repetition can become extreme, and changing your colors can become quite a chore. To make this more tolerable, most professional developers use a CSS preprocessor tool, the most popular of which is known as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.</p>

<p>For this step, rewrite your <code>main.css</code> file in the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide">SCSS language</a>, taking advantage of variables, nesting, and functions. Then use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/install">the sass command line tool</a>, to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass">generate</a> your <code>main.css</code> file from your <code>main.scss</code> file. While you're working on this, you will probably want to use their feature that <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass">watches your source SCSS file</a> and automatically regenerates the target CSS whenever the source SCSS file changes.</p>

<p>Use variables for all your colors. For the darker background on the cafe info and story sections, use the Sass <code>darken()</code> function to darken the page background by <code>5%</code>. For the footer background color, darken the page background by <code>20%</code>.</p>

<p>Also use a variable for the set of fall-back fonts that are used if Lato and Raleway cannot be downloaded from the Google fonts server.</p>
